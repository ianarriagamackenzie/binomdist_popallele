# Binomial Distribution for Summary Genetic Data

Summary population allele data can be modeled using a binomial mixture distribtion with homogeneous reference populations. Here are two example scripts showing this binomial mixture using public gnomAD v2.1 data and 1000 Genomes data.

**binomialdistribution.R** : Plot the log-likelihood of the gnomAD African/African-American data, and show its African and European admixture.

**HiddenAncestryEstimation.R** : Generate admixed populations from known population allele frequencies, and attempt to estimate a hidden or unknown ancestry.
